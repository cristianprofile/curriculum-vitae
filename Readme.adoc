== Profile

I am an enthusiastic programmer, in 2 words I am an eternal student.
14 years using a lot of languages, but specialized in JAVA SPRING
and every Frameworks around it. I love Kotlin language because
it has a lot of features that make my life as programmer easier. (I hate null pointer exception)

Interested in web, mobile, testing new databases needed to be able to resolve
new problems with a better approach than old relational database:

Elasticsearch, Redis, Mongo, Neo4j, Influxdb.

This last year I am learning the complex word :microservices solutions.I am learning new ways of work with a complex
distribution system. Actually I am trying to learn how to use new Kafka solutionto be able to create event driven microservices and studying
new ways to create application improving startup time like Micronaut (Spring boot is improving startup time but it is too slow yet)
